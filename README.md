soketipfs is a framework for building distributed applications using Websockets. It is built on top of [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) and uses the IPFS networking protocol via [Helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia).

## ü§ù Supporting

soketipfs is meant to be open source, forever and ever. It solves issues that many developers face - the one of wanting to be limitless while testing locally or performing benchmarks. More than that, itt is also suited for production usage, either it is public for your frontend applications or internal to your team.

The frequency of releases and maintenance is based on the available time, which is tight as hell. Recently, there were issues with the maintenance and this caused infrequent updates, as well as infrequent support.

To cover some of the expenses of handling new features or having to maintain the project, we would be more than happy if you can donate towards the goal. This will ensure that soketipfs will be taken care of at its full extent.

## Features

### SRF (üåç Scalable | ‚ú® Resilient | üèéÔ∏è Fast)

soketipfs is built with the SRF principles in mind. It is designed to be scalable, resilient and fast by nature, leveraging the power of uWebSockets.js and the IPFS networking.

While IPFS is public, soketipfs is designed to be used in private networks, where you can control the nodes that are part of the network ‚Äî you have a fully private and secure network for your real-time application. üöÄ

The server is built on top of [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) - a C application ported to Node.js. uWebSockets.js is demonstrated to perform at levels [_8.5x that of Fastify_](https://alexhultman.medium.com/serving-100k-requests-second-from-a-fanless-raspberry-pi-4-over-ethernet-fdd2c2e05a1e) and at least [_10x that of Socket.IO_](https://medium.com/swlh/100k-secure-websockets-with-raspberry-pi-4-1ba5d2127a23). ([_source_](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js))

### Cheaper ü§ë

For a $49 plan on Pusher, you get a limited amount of connections (500) and messages (30M).

With soketipfs, for the price of an instance on Vultr or DigitalOcean ($5-$10), you get virtually unlimited connections, messages, and some more!

soketipfs is capable to hold thousands of active connections with high traffic on less than **1 GB and 1 CPU** in the cloud. You can also [get free $100 on Vultr to try out soketipfs ‚Üí](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9032189-8H)

### Pusher Protocol üì°

soketipfs implements the [Pusher Protocol v7](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/library\_auth\_reference/pusher-websockets-protocol#version-7-2017-11). Your existing projects that connect to Pusher requires minimal code change to make it work with soketipfs - you just add the host and port and swap the credentials.

### Packages

soketipfs is a monorepo, and it's composed of the following packages:

- [brain](./packages/brain/README.md): Used to cache data in memory
- [connections](./packages/connections/README.md): Base implementation for Websocket connections handling
- [gossiper](./packages/gossiper/README.md): Integration for the Gossip protocol, used to broadcast messages to all nodes in the network
- [routing](./packages/routing/README.md): Unified implementation for HTTP routing or handling custom events in the network
- [server](./packages/server/README.md): Ready-to-go & customizable server implemenations for soketipfs
- [utils](./packages/utils/README.md): Utility functions used across the packages

Each abstraction has its own place in the soketipfs ecosystem, and they can be used independently or together.
